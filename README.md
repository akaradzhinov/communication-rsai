    * server.port - the port on which the application is going to be started on

#ModuleMappings
    This enum should contain the mappings to the external urls to the other modules.
    GEAR("gear","www.example.come") -> this represents the module from which the data came (in this case module "gear")
                                       and the url of the endpoint where the data should be sent (www.example.come)
    
#URL for sending data
    {baseUrl}:{server.port}/communication/send
    
#Example request and payload
    POST ->     http://localhost:8080/communication/send
    HEADERS ->  Content-type: application/json
    body -> 
    {

      "value": {
                 "gear":4,
                 "rpm":4500
               }
    }

            Example request:
                http://localhost:8080/communication/messages

            Example response:

                      "value":{
                         "warnForSeatbelt":true,
                         "warningSeverity":"high"
                      }
                   },
